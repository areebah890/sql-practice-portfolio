# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Areebah 

Welcome to my personal learning portfolio. I'm currently studying Cybersecurity at university and building skills in **data analysis**, **SQL**, and **security labs** like TryHackMe.

This repo contains my **SQL practice**, **cyber labs**, and small **personal projects**.

## Skills in Progress

- SQL (via SQLBolt & Kaggle)
- Data Analysis (Excel, Power BI, Python basics)
- Cybersecurity (TryHackMe, Linux, networking)
- Git & GitHub

## Projects & Practice

### SQL Practice
- `sqlbolt-lessons.sql` â†’ Practice queries from SQLBolt (Lessons 1â€“10)
- `SQL-Basics.md` â†’ Notes on core SQL concepts

### TryHackMe Labs
- `tryhackme-notes.md` â†’ Notes from completed rooms (e.g., Intro to SOC, Blue Team Labs, Linux Basics)

### Personal Projects
